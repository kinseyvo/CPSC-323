Programmed by Kinsey Vo and Anthony Tran

This program is a parser which recognizes and evaluates an arithmetic expression generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG).
Int is a terminal symbol representing integers.

- Error message if input arithmetic expression is not in the lanaguage of the given grammer
- Calculates result of input arithmetic expression if valid
- Unary minus (-) has precedence over all operators
- Parentheses have precedence over the binary operators *, /, +, and -
- * and / have precedence over the binary operators + and -

Grammar G:
E -> E + T | E – T | -E | T
T -> T * F | T/F | F
F -> int | (E)

Grammar G':
E -> -EE' | TE'
E' -> +TE' | -TE' | ε
T -> FT'
T' -> *FT' | /FT' | ε
F -> int | (E)

To run this program:
1) Download py file (ex: 323proj2.py).
2) Run program (in VSCode: click "Run Python File" button in upper right hand corner)
- Once code compiles and runs, enter an arithmetic expression (ex: 6+9) and output will follow (ex: 15)
